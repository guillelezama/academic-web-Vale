### Working papers 

"_Political consequences of technological change_" 2021.

While there is little doubt that technological change is generating labor market polarization (LMP), we know very little about how economic polarization translates into political polarization and how these effects are moderated by the institutional environment. I argue that LMP translates into political polarization and that outsider (extreme) party leaders have a strategic advantage in electoral competition under these circumstances. Against the commonly held view that parties under majoritarianism are moderated by the median voter, I argue that winner-take-all systems can be prone to policy extremism. In contexts where candidates and parties must build coalitions to govern, policy positions are moderated but non-policy issues such as values are more extreme. I build a theoretical model for better understanding the political economy of polarization by extending a model of electoral competition between a mainstream and populist party leader. Then I evaluate its empirical implications using party manifesto data, and the cases of the US and Germany. The findings shed light on the relationship between polarization and electoral and party institutions. Polarization  over  redistribution  policies  is  smaller  in  countries  with PR electoral systems than in countries with majoritarian two-party systems. Moreover, routine voters are more likely to switch from the establishment to populist party leaders in a context of increasing job polarization.

"_Legislators’ Religiosity and Same-Sex Marriage in Latin America_" 2021 with [Scott Morgenstern](https://smorgens.wixsite.com/website) _Under Review_

The issue of same-sex marriage has risen to the top of political agendas across Latin America, and it has thus drawn much attention from students of public opinion.  However, we still know very little about how legislators—those who make the policies—feel about LGBTQ+ same-sex marriage.  In response, we utilize a survey of the region’s legislators to first examine the range in support among countries and show how it correlates with legal changes.  We then examine the correlates of support of legislators themselves.  While gender, age, and ideology play minor roles, our multivariate models confirm that religiosity drives support in two ways: not only does it affect legislators’ individual level of support in the expected direction, it also works as a contextual variable such that having even a few more secular colleagues encourages pious legislators to support same sex marriage, and vice versa.

"_Effects of minimum wage on workforce composition across firms: Does firms' size matters?_" 2019. 

Between 2004 and 2006, the Uruguayan government implemented significant changes in labor market policy by rising minimum wages and installing coordinated wage bargaining for all firms. Together, these two policies implied a shock in terms of the level of wages that firms had to pay for. However, the rise of minimum wage affected small firms significantly more than their large counterparts. I exploit this fact to evaluate the impacts of minimum wages on several important outcomes. I analyze changes in the evolution of workforce composition by looking at the skill distribution, and differences in hiring conditions such as the evolution of wages and social security contributions (SSC). My empirical design implements a fuzzy difference-in-differences approach, which compares changes in outcome variables before and after policy implementation. The results suggest that the labor policy led to heterogeneous effects across firms according to their exposure to treatment (i.e., firms' size). During the period, social security contributions increased more in small firms and wages increased more in large ones. Moreover, the distribution of skills among firms shows a composition effect by which small firms hired less skilled employees than large ones. Overall, the policy increased the cost of labor in small firms more than in large firms. For small firms, this implied an increase in social security effort and a reduction of wages relative to large firms. As a consequence, the policy also affected workers' sorting by helping more productive workers moving toward larger firms.
